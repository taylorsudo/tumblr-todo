# Tumblr Todo

Fork of [x the todo app by peeyuzz](https://github.com/peeyuzz/x-the-todo-app) for Tumblr

![Demo](https://github.com/taylorsudo/tumblr-todo/blob/main/demo.gif?raw=true)

## about
this is a chrome extension that replaces the ~~trending section on x.com~~ **Tumblr Premium ad on the sidebar** with your todo list. it also ~~reminds you of pending tasks when you open x.com and every 15 minutes while browsing~~ replaces the junk in tumblr's carousel with a number of astrological/seasonal calendars, as per anon's request. and a list of time zones, for me!

## installation
1. clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/taylorsudo/tumblr-todo.git
   ```
2. open chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. enable developer mode (top right corner)
4. click "load unpacked" and select the cloned folder

for my non-technical friends, click on the green "code" button on the top right of this page, download the zip file, unzip it, and then unpack it in your browser's extension manager.

## usage
- ~~click the extension icon~~ jsut use the sidebar to add tasks
- when you open ~~x.com~~ **tumblr.com**, your todo list will be shown in place of ~~trending~~ **the Tumblr Premium ad on the sidebar**
- ~~a popup will remind you of pending tasks when you open x.com and every 15 minutes~~
